# Release Notes for HugeSeq v1.2 #
##################################

++++ 2/20/12 ++++

NOTE:  This is an alpha release.  Several components will need
to be adjusted to work on other systems.

## OPEN ISSUES ##

* Many environment variables must be set.  See the hugeseq module
file for an example.

* Hardcoded paths to a GATK key must be changed in clean_realn.sh
and var_snp.sh

* Package has never been tested on external systems.  Unforeseen
issues may arise

## FIXED ISSUES ##

* Hardcoded paths in scripts removed and replaced with
environment variables

* Java process memory allocation adjusted to accommodate
larger heap sizes

* sam_sort step no longer fails due to outdated BAI
files
