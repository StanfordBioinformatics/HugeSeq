##################################

++++ 2/20/12 ++++

NOTE:  This is an alpha release.  Several components will need
to be adjusted to work on other systems.

* Many environment variables must be set.  See the hugeseq module
file for an example.

* Hardcoded paths to a GATK key must be changed in clean_realn.sh
and var_snp.sh

* Package has never been tested on external systems.  Unforeseen
issues may arise
